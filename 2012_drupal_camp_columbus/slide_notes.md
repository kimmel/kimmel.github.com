11. slide: usability is:

  Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use.

  Usability is defined by 5 quality components:

* Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?

* Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?

* Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
    
* Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?

* Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?

14. slide: deck

The Surface Plane: On the surface you see a series of web pages made up of images and text that will tell you where you are, where you can go and what is here.

15. slide: skeleton

The Skeleton Plane: Beneath the surface is the skeleton of the site – the layout and placement of where those buttons, images and text are to be for maximum effect and efficiency of your site.


16. slide: structure

The Structure Plane: The structure of your site is a more concrete expression of the skeleton of your site – defining how the user got to the page they are on and where else they could go. The skeleton might define the arrangement of the navigation while the structure would define what those categories actually were.

17 slide: scope


The Scope Plane: As the structure defines the way in which the various features and functions of the site fit together, the scope defines what the purpose behind those features and functions are.

18 slide: the strategy

The Strategy Plane: The scope of your website is fundamentally determined by the strategy of your site – what the company is trying to gain from the website and what they want the users to leave their site with.

Our goal is usefulness

Utility = whether it provides the features you need.
Usability = how easy & pleasant these features are to use.
Useful = usability + utility.

functional, practical, and convenient.


Graceful degredation = uber experience, and then crappy pieces when broken.

progressive enhancement = I am going to build up from the core and add on top of that.
